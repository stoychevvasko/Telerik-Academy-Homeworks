Hello and thanks for checking my homework, friend!


I've validated it using the W3C validator tool. My errors are mostly the use of
depricated HTML styling with advice to use CSS which is fair enough. We'll cover that 
material in due time.

I've got a problem with the table error messages though - it keeps telling me of inconsistent
number of column/row elements and this happens whenever there is a table with merged cells.

Do you have any advice for me on how to resolve those errors and still fulfill homework requirements?

Thanks for spending some time reading this =) Your help is much appreciated =)


Cheers!
